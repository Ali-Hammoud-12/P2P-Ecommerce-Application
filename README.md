P2P-Ecommerce-Application
-------------------------
This project aims to develop a peer-to-peer (P2P) commerce application that facilitates transactions between individuals who wish to buy and sell products. The application will leverage the power of digital technologies and social networks to connect buyers and sellers, and foster a community of users based on trust and reputation. Through the development of this application, the project seeks to address the growing demand for P2P commerce solutions, while also contributing to the evolution of the retail landscape in the digital age providing a viable alternative to traditional retail channels.

This project focuses on creating a user-friendly marketplace that enables customers to buy various products. The login screen allows users to select whether they are a customer or a shop owner, and upon registering, they are required to verify their identity via email. The onboarding screen provides an overview of the application's features, including online shopping, delivery options, and worldwide shipping. The product screen, accessible to customers, displays a list of products arranged by category, such as gadgets, beauty, clothes, and home items, complete with their corresponding prices. The checkout screen facilitates payment processing, allowing customers to choose their preferred method of payment and delivery service, with associated shipping costs displayed. They can also review their cart and remove items if necessary. The review screen allows customers to rate products and leave comments for others to see. On the other hand, shop owners can list their products, monitor their inventory, and modify their profiles, including payment options. The admin screen is accessible only to the admin and contains a list of users and their activities. The admin can ban users who breach the application's terms and conditions, edit the terms, and review the listed items. However, the admin cannot buy or sell products, and only products meeting the application's criteria are approved for listing.
